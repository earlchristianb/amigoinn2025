# üö® REQUIRED: Database Migration Instructions

## The Error You're Seeing:
```
Unknown argument `label`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

This means the database doesn't have the `label` and `price` columns yet in the `booking_extras` table.

## ‚úÖ How to Fix:

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration in Supabase

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Go to your project ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
3. Click **"New Query"**
4. **Copy and paste this SQL:**

```sql
-- Complete migration for booking_extras table

-- Step 1: Drop the view that depends on booking_extras.deleted_at
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS booking_payment_summary;

-- Step 2: Add new columns to booking_extras
ALTER TABLE booking_extras 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS label TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS price DECIMAL(12, 2);

-- Step 3: Make extra_id nullable
ALTER TABLE booking_extras 
ALTER COLUMN extra_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- Step 4: For existing records, populate label and price from the extras table
UPDATE booking_extras be
SET 
  label = e.name,
  price = e.price
FROM extras e
WHERE be.extra_id = e.id
  AND be.label IS NULL;

-- Step 5: Set default values for any remaining NULL values
UPDATE booking_extras
SET 
  label = COALESCE(label, 'Custom Extra'),
  price = COALESCE(price, 0)
WHERE label IS NULL OR price IS NULL;

-- Step 6: Now make label and price NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE booking_extras 
ALTER COLUMN label SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN price SET NOT NULL;

-- Step 7: Recreate the booking_payment_summary view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW booking_payment_summary AS
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.guest_id,
  b.total_price,
  b.discount,
  b.status,
  b.proof_image_url,
  b.created_at,
  b.updated_at,
  b.deleted_at,
  COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) AS total_paid,
  (b.total_price - COALESCE(b.discount, 0) - COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0)) AS remaining_balance,
  CASE 
    WHEN COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) >= (b.total_price - COALESCE(b.discount, 0)) THEN 'fully_paid'
    WHEN COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) > 0 THEN 'partially_paid'
    ELSE 'unpaid'
  END AS payment_status
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN payments p ON b.id = p.booking_id AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE b.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY b.id, b.guest_id, b.total_price, b.discount, b.status, b.proof_image_url, b.created_at, b.updated_at, b.deleted_at;

-- Step 8: Drop admin_emails table (since we're using profiles now)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS admin_emails;
```

5. Click **"Run"** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
6. Wait for "Success" message

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client

After the SQL runs successfully, run this in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ After Migration:

You'll be able to:
- ‚úÖ Create bookings with only extras (no rooms)
- ‚úÖ Use the dropdown to select extras
- ‚úÖ Have label and price automatically populated

---

**‚ùó IMPORTANT: You MUST run the SQL in Supabase first. The application won't work until the database schema is updated.**
